## üöÄ Usage

Here‚Äôs an example of how to use the library to start a network session:

```javascript

const client = new UqmiClient("cdc-wdm0", {
    host: "192.168.1.1",
    port: 22,
    username: "user",
    password: "password",
});

// Start a network session
(async () => {
    try {
        const versions = await uqmi.getVersions();
        console.log("Device Versions:", versions);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to get device versions:", error);
    }
})();
```

### SSH options

```typescript
/**
 * SSH connection options for connecting to a remote device.
 *
 * @property {string} host - The SSH server hostname or IP address.
 * @property {number} [port=22] - The port to connect to (default is 22).
 * @property {string} username - The username to authenticate as on the SSH server.
 * @property {string} [password] - The password for authentication (used if no private key is provided).
 * @property {string} [privateKeyPath] - The path to the private key file for authentication (if password is not used).
 * @property {string} [passphrase] - The passphrase to unlock the private key (if the key is encrypted).
 */
export interface SSHOptions {
    host: string;
    port?: number;
    username: string;
    password?: string;
    privateKeyPath?: string;
    passphrase?: string;
}
```

## üîç Finding Device Name
